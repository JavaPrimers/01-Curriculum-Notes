What is Java?

	Semi Object Oriented Programming language that was created by James Gosling 
	Object Oriented programming has 4 pillars, inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction and Polymorphism
	(Almost) Everything is a class - except for primitives

	Java is a high-level, compiled, strongly typed OOP language.

Advantages of Java?
	
	The syntax is C-language inspired. 
	Platform independent 
	Automatic Memory Management
	Open Source
	Extensive built-in libraries (as well as a lot of external libraries and frameworks)
	Supported by Oracle 


What do I need to develop Java applications?
	JDK - Java Development Kit 
	JDK contains everything we need to build, compile and run Java code. 

What do I need to *run* Java application?
	JRE - Java Runtime Environment. 
	JRE allows us to run Java applications, that's all thanks to the JVM. 

What is the JVM?
	The JVM is JAva Virtual Machine. JVM will translate our bytecode into machine code. 
	(Thanks to the JVM that we have platform independence)


	Java being platform independent means that Java programs are not constrained to a single 
	operating system - Java code can be run on many different systems. Java program can be written 
	in any one of these operating systems and then *compiled* into *bytecode*.
	(WORA - Write Once Run Anywhere)

	The JVM can then translate the bytecode into any OS/machine specific code. Many operating 
	systems have their own JVM. 

	In order to run Java applications, we actually need the JRE. The JRE contains core libraries
	that we levarage as well as contain the JVM. All you need to run Java code is a JRE.
